MAIN COMPONENTS:
	1) an unified interface to remote storages.  there will be many
	2) a local compact and fast database for storing the whole or part of the remote file system. it should at least store and keep in sync all metadata
	3) virtual file system mounters. This will create a filesystem on the machine that is indistinguishable from a pendrive. every file operation will be computed with the help of 2, and may result in effects on 1
	4) a management UI for controlling all this stuff. Something simple, just for creating accounts, mounting folders, seeing stats, changing configs and so on. Maybe where will be a TUI too
